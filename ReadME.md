Technical Aspects i used here as per requirement developed by using vanilla javascript, Dom manipulation can be very costly based on number of elements. keeping this i trid the approach of copying the existing nodes/elements and perform action on copied elements.replacing the mutated nodes at the end. so in this case we are only doing 1 dom manipulation per click.
